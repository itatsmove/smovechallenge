# Booking Ordering Problem
Unlike the other challenges, this one requires you to programmatically solve a specific problem.

You are given a set of data representing a sequence of bookings on a single car. Each booking consists of a start location and an end location. Given two adjacent bookings *b1* and *b2*, we say a *relocation* is required between those bookings if the end location of *b1* ≠ the start location of *b2*.

For example,

```
using the format [start_location     end_location],

   b1        b2
[a     b] [c     d] = relocation required (b ≠ c)

   b1        b2
[a     b] [b     c] = no relocation required (b = b)
```


Your task is to design and implement an algorithm that takes a sequence of bookings as input, and outputs a _single_ permutation of the input that minimises the total number of relocations within the sequence. For example, given

```
   b1         b2        b3        b4
[x     y] [z     x] [y     z] [y     z] = 3 relocations required
```

you could return

```
   b3         b2        b1        b4
[y     z] [z     x] [x     y] [y     z] = 0 relocations required
```

If you find multiple sequences with the same number of relocations, you can return any of them - it does not matter which. It is the 'score', i.e. the number of relocations, that matters.

The output sequence must contain the same set of bookings as the input (that is, you can't add or remove any bookings), and you cannot change the start or end locations of any bookings. Note that it might not be possible to find a reordered sequence with 0 relocations. Your job is simply to minimise the number as much as possible.

Feel free to use any language/framework/library you'd like, but make sure it's easy for us to build and run!

### Input Format
A JSON file consisting of an array of booking objects. Each object has an `id`, `start`, and `end`. E.g.:

```
[
	{ "id": 1, "start": 23, "end": 42 },

	{ "id": 2, "start": 77, "end": 45},

	{ "id": 3, "start": 42, "end": 77 },

	. . .
]
```

### Output Format
A JSON file consisting of an array of booking IDs of the reordered sequence. E.g., given the above input:

```
[1, 3, 2]
```

### File
[bookingordering.json](bookingordering.json)
