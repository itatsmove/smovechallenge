# Challenge
Here you'll find a set of simple APIs that return data about bookings, cars, and availability.

For this challenge, we'd like you to use any or all of these endpoints to build any kind of front end application you'd like - let your creativity shine through in building something interesting!

What we're looking for is something that shows your creativity, deep understanding of front end design patterns, an eye for performance, and your ability to develop something you'd be proud to put into production.

# Requirements
Our only requirement is that you use [React](https://reactjs.org/).

Any CSS pre-processing libraries, testing frameworks, build frameworks, state management libraries, etc. is completely up to you! However, note that we generally try to keep a dependency-lite stack, so the fewer the better.

# APIs
* [Bookings API](apis/bookings.md) - returns a list of bookings
* [Availability API](apis/availability.md) - given a set of times, returns a list of available locations
* [Car Location API](apis/carlocation.md) - returns a list of cars and their current location

# Submission
When you're done, send us back a link to a repository with your source code, with a description of what you've done and any build instructions in the readme!

If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to reach out to us!
