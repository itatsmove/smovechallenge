# Hardware Challenge

In this challenge, we plan to design a sensor shield for Arduino Uno. The Shield will include:
* a MPU9250 IMU
* a BMP280 barometer
* an OPT3001 ambient light sensor
* a real-time clock with backup battery PCF8523T

Your tasks are to:
1. Design schematic and PCB layout (with 2 layers) for the Shield
2. Create Bill of Material for the Shield

**Notes**:
* You can use any CAD tool (or Paint :)) to design the PCB, and submit it in PDF format
* Arduino Uno will provide 3.3V and GND for the shield via headers
