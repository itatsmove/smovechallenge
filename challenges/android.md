# Android Challenge

The purpose of this challenge is for you to show off some of your engineering / design skills by building an app to consume some of our API endpoints.

You can use the endpoints below in any way you'd like, and create something as simple or complex as you want! You could build a booking interface, an app to track where our cars are, or even perform some data analysis / visualisation!

In the end, what we want to see is your ability to get creative with your solution, and your ability to write high quality and elegant code. That said, we'd love to see solutions that make use of things like data persistance and user location.

See below for the details on the API endpoints, and don't hesitate to ask us any questions about them!

## Endpoints
1. [Booking Availability API](availability.md)
2. [Car Location API](location.md)

## Requirements
* App should be designed for different devices / screen sizes
* Interface should be built programmatically (e.g. not using Layout Editor)

**When you're done, send us back a link to a repository with your source code and apk, with a description of what you've done and any build instructions in the readme!**
