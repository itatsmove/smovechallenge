# Booking Availability API
Here you'll find a simple endpoint that you can use to check for booking availability. Given a start time and an end time, it returns a set of possible start locations for a booking, each with the number of cars available at that location, and a set of possible drop off locations.

Use the endpoint to build whatever you'd like, be it a simple front end to make bookings, an analysis tool, or even some visualisations. Feel free to use any language/framework you'd like, but make sure it's easy for us to build!

### Endpoint
```
GET https://challenge.smove.sg/availability?startTime=[startTime]&endTime=[endTime]

| Field        | Type         | Description  |

| [endTime]      | Number | The desired end time of the booking, as a unix timestamp |
