# Smove Challenges

The purpose of this repository is to challenge you to show us some of your skills in programming, web development, visualisation, analysis, infrastructure design, security, and everything in between.

## Software Engineer Challenges

We've prepared a few resources that you can use in any way you'd like. Some of them are open ended, meaning you can take any direction you want and build a website, a visualisation, do some analysis, or anything else you can think of. For the more algorithmically-inclined, we've also provided some common problems that we solve daily for you to have a shot at.

**You're welcome to try as many challenges as you'd like**, and implement your solution using any language/framework/library you desire. Some languages and frameworks we typically use at smove are Javascript, Python, AngularJS, React, and Sails.js, so if you can use those that's a bonus!

1. [Booking Availability API](challenges/availability.md)
2. [Car Location API](challenges/location.md)
