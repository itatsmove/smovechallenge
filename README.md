# Smove Challenges

At Smove, we don't believe in hardcore whiteboarding interviews or timeboxed online algorithm challenges for our engineers. Instead, we'd like to give you the freedom to choose the types of problems you want to solve, and the time for you to do them well.

To achieve that, we have a number of challenges for each role, with as few restrictions / requirements as possible. We want to give you a chance to show us your skills in programming, web development, visualisation, analysis, infrastructure design, security, and everything in between.

Note that we're not solely looking for the most 'correct' or 'optimal' solution. Instead, we're interested in seeing the creativity of your submission, the quality and readability of your code, the types of dependencies you rely on, the documentation, commit quality, etc. In other words, write something that you'd be proud to present to your team.

Most importantly, make sure you have fun doing the challenge! And of course, if you have any questions or concerns, feel free to reach out to us!

Cheers,
Smove's geeks ðŸ¤“

P.s. we'd love some feedback on the challenges too! If you have any feedback, good or bad, let us know in your response!

## Front End Engineer Challenges

### Challenges
1. [Frontend Challenge](challenges/frontend.md)

## Full Stack Engineer Challenges

We've prepared a few resources that you can use in any way you'd like. Some of them are open ended, meaning you can take any direction you want and build a website, a visualisation, do some analysis, or anything else you can think of. For the more algorithmically-inclined, we've also provided some common problems that we solve daily for you to have a shot at.

**You're welcome to try as many challenges as you'd like**, and implement your solution using any language/framework/library you desire. Some languages and frameworks we typically use at smove are Javascript, Python, AngularJS, React, and Sails.js, so if you can use those that's a bonus!
